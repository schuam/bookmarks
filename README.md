# bookmarks

So, I was a little annoyed by not finding resources (documentation, tutorials,
videos, recipes, or what ever) that I knew I had looked for before. I needed a
why to manage my bookmarks. Somehow browser bookmarks don't work well for me,
because I work on different machines, in different locations, with different
browsers, etc. I know there are bookmark managers that keep your bookmarks
synchronized between different computers and browsers, but somehow I haven't
found one that I liked. Maybe I haven't look long enough, I don't know. But I
wanted to collect all my bookmarks in one central location, that I can access
from anywhere. This is what this repo is for.

I don't know what will develop out of it, I might create a database and a
django app to access it in the future. Or come up with some other solution, but
for now this README file will be, where I just drop all my bookmarks in a
hopefully somewhat structured way.

Some of the links might be useful for others, other links might be pretty
specific to my needs. I still thought I make it a public, so anyone that finds
my list of links useful is welcome to use it.
